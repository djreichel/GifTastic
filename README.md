# GifTastic
Create a dynamic web page which displays themed gifs from the Giphy API.

This is a sample of code created by D.J. Reichel.
The objective of this project was to create a mechanism to dynamically create buttons based on user input.
And to make a call to the Giphy API to return giphs appropriate to the buttons clicked by the user.
